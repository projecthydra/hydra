## Acknowledgements  
The initial insights and ideas behind producting a "distro-like" gem to reflect a particular known-good, 
point-in-time state of the Hydra technology stack resulted from a series of community discussions online, 
in e-mail, and in person during the period from December 2012 through June 2013.  Huge thanks are owed to
Jeremy Friesen (Notre Dame), Drew Myers (WGBH), Justin Coyne (Data Curation Experts),
and Mark Bussey (Data Curation Experts) for activating on these ideas and implementing this gem.  

A giant thank you is also owed to [Nick Gauthier](https://github.com/ngauthier) for offering up the Hydra gem name:

### ngauthier-hydra
